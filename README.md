# IntuitivePulseApp

## Project Overview

**IntuitivePulseApp** is an innovative application designed to collect heart rate data from smartwatches and transmit it to an analytical center for predicting anxiety-related events.  

The app aims to:  
- **Monitor heart rate:** Continuously gather real-time pulse data.  
- **Detect anomalies:** Identify abnormal heart rate patterns that may indicate stress or anxiety.  
- **Alert system:** Send automatic alerts to users or emergency contacts if critical thresholds are reached.  
- **Data analysis:** Transmit anonymized data to a central server for further analysis and AI-based pattern recognition.  

Our goal is to empower users with proactive mental health support through real-time physiological tracking.  

## Folder Structure

- `/app` — Source code of the application.  
- `/data` — Test data and simulations of heart rate fluctuations.  

Stay tuned for further updates!
